# Modulating-Delay
** NOT WORKING YET **

So i'm trying to make a delay that you can modulate the feedback and milliseconds by a function or the signal itself.
It is a delay i use on max and it is simple but i never see it on a VST, so i'm making it myself, muahaha >:D.

Problems:
* Not sure if it is following correctly the wave-table;
* I have not figured out a way to transport the data of a class inside a component to another class.

However I worked a lot in this project today, and i'm an occupied person, i have few time per day to mess up with programming, so i'll fix later and it'll probably take a while.
