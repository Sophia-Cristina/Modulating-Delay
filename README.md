# Modulating-Delay
** NOT WORKING YET **

So i'm trying to make a delay that you can modulate the feedback and milliseconds by a function or the signal itself.
It is a delay i use on max and it is simple but i never see it on a VST, so i'm making it myself, muahaha >:D.

Problems:
* I think i'll have to add a counter because i'm using the writer position to the modulation formula and it resets;
* There is an annoying click (or break, or something) that is annoying me, i have to fix it.

However I worked a lot in this project today, and i'm an occupied person, i have few time per day to mess up with programming, so i'll fix later and it'll probably take a while.
